# Task Manager

A specialized tool to manage context isolation and focused task execution with Claude, solving the critical challenge of context length limitations and task focus when working on complex, multi-step projects.

## Features

- **Task Breakdown**: Intelligently parse complex projects into focused, self-contained tasks
- **Context Isolation**: Execute each task with a clean context window
- **Project Organization**: Organize tasks into projects with proper metadata and sequencing
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion and project status
- **Execution Control**: Run tasks individually or in sequence with proper result management

## Usage

The Task Manager helps you break down large projects into manageable chunks that fit within Claude's context window and maintain focus on individual tasks.

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a project structure** for organizing your tasks
2. **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, self-contained pieces
3. **Execute tasks individually** with clean context
4. **Track progress** and manage results

### Advanced Usage

```
# Organize a complex project
1. Define project scope and goals
2. Break into logical task sequences
3. Create task files with complete context
4. Execute in proper order
5. Collect and integrate results
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Website Development Project

Break down a website project into focused tasks:

```
Project: E-commerce Website
├── 001_requirements_analysis.md
├── 002_database_design.md
├── 003_frontend_layout.md
├── 004_backend_api.md
├── 005_user_authentication.md
├── 006_payment_integration.md
└── 007_testing_deployment.md
```

### Example 2: Content Creation Project

Organize a content creation workflow:

```
Project: Technical Documentation
├── 001_content_outline.md
├── 002_user_research.md
├── 003_writing_guide.md
├── 004_technical_sections.md
├── 005_examples_tutorials.md
└── 006_review_publishing.md
```

## Configuration

To effectively use the Task Manager:

- **Project Structure**: Organize tasks in numbered sequence for clarity
- **Task Files**: Include complete context and instructions in each task
- **Dependencies**: Clearly define task relationships and execution order
- **Result Tracking**: Maintain consistent output format for integration

## Notes

- **Context Isolation**: Each task should be self-contained with all necessary information
- **Task Sizing**: Keep individual tasks focused and manageable (typically 1-3 specific outcomes)
- **Sequencing**: Order tasks logically to build upon previous results
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear project overview and task relationships
- **Flexibility**: Allow for task modification based on intermediate results

## Arguments

When breaking down projects, consider:

- Project scope and complexity
- Available time and resources  
- Dependencies between tasks
- Required expertise for each task
- Integration points and deliverables
